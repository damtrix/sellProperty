## The Story

Sell Property initially had a different vision compared to its current state. It was conceived as a comprehensive solution that aimed to simplify property sales, aid in property location, and act as an escrow service between sellers and potential buyers. However, due to the complexity of the idea and time constraints, some of the envisioned features were postponed for future development, and the focus shifted towards delivering a minimum viable product (MVP).

The user interface of Sell Property is built using React, while the backend is powered by Node.js, and the database utilizes MongoDB. The implementation follows a REST API approach, enabling seamless communication between the frontend and backend in a straightforward and well-documented manner. This design choice also allows for easy enhancements and the incorporation of additional microservices in the future.

Front End

- React components handling routing
- styled-component for consistent styling
- Redux toolkits for state management
- API calls to manipulate database

REST API

- GET, POST, PUT requests handled
- CRUD manipulation through REST API

Relational Database

- Handled with mongoDB
